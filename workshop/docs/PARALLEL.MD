✅ &nbsp;How to implement parallelization

## In today's world, it's improbable to succeed without parallelization

> "Once you have these automated tests, our analysis shows it’s important to run them regularly. Every commit should trigger a build of the software and running a set of fast, automated tests. Developers should get feedback from a more comprehensive suite of acceptance and performance tests every day. Furthermore, current builds should be available to testers for exploratory testing." (Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations)

Try to run the current suite of tests:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=E2ESolutionTests
```

This is how long my tests took

241 sec/8 tests = 30 sec/test

## 🏋️‍♀Implement parallelization

1. Go to `pom.xml` and add the following at the same level as the `<dependencies>` node

```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
                <configuration>
                    <parallel>all</parallel>
                    <threadCountMethods>100</threadCountMethods>
                    <useUnlimitedThreads>true</useUnlimitedThreads>
                    <redirectTestOutputToFile>false</redirectTestOutputToFile>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

2. In terminal run

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=E2ESolutionTests
```

3. Login to saucelabs.com and watch tests run in parallel
